"""Append a pass/fail summary of Bazel test targets to the GitHub job summary.

Reads the Build Event Protocol JSON (Bazel's --build_event_json_file), building on
the testSummary parse in buildscripts/gather_failed_tests.py. The BEP is always
written locally and carries a testSummary event per target with its overallStatus
-- unlike test.xml, which under --remote_download_outputs=minimal stays in the
remote cache and is not on the runner.

A target is reported as one of three outcomes so a cancelled or interrupted run
stays honest:
  * passed     -- overallStatus PASSED or FLAKY (passed on retry);
  * failed     -- a failing overallStatus, OR any individual testResult failed
                  (the latter catches a real failure even when the suite's
                  aggregate summary never finalized because the run was killed);
  * incomplete -- a target that was started but never reached a verdict
                  (NO_STATUS / INCOMPLETE), e.g. the in-flight suite when the
                  workflow is cancelled.

With --detailed (used for unittests), the summary also reports how many targets
actually executed vs were served from cache (per-testResult cachedLocally /
executionInfo.cachedRemotely) and adds a collapsible per-target table.

Writes Markdown to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY (or stdout when unset, for local runs).
Always exits 0 -- reporting must never mask the real `bazel test` exit code.
