/**
 * Test override that makes the ldapauthz suite run against the Python mock LDAP server
 * (jstests/ldapauthz/lib/ldap_mock.py) instead of a real slapd.
 *
 * It is imported (once per test) via the `eval` shell option of the ldapauthz_mock suite,
 * so the individual ldapauthz_*.js test files need no changes.
 *
 * Why this wraps MongoRunner rather than starting the mock directly at import time: the
 * `eval` script runs inside its own MongoProgramScope in the mongo shell (see
 * mongo_main.cpp), whose destructor kills every spawned program when the eval finishes --
 * i.e. before the test file runs. A mock started at import time would therefore be killed
 * before the first mongod starts. Starting it lazily from inside the runMongod wrapper
 * means it is spawned while the *test file* is executing, so it lives under the test
 * file's MongoProgramScope.
 *
 * The shell also fails a test (exit code != 0) if any child process is still running when
 * the test file finishes. So the stopMongod wrapper tears the mock down again: every
 * ldapauthz test stops its mongod(s) at the end, so the mock is always gone before the
 * end-of-file check. Tearing it down also resets TestData.ldapServers to the sentinel, so
 * a test that starts a second mongod (e.g. ldapauthz_ldap_timeouts.js) gets a fresh mock.
 *
 * Deliberately-invalid addresses such as "localhost:39999" are passed through untouched,
 * since only the sentinel value is rewritten.
